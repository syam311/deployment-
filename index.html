        <h4>Home</h4>
        <p>A <a href="#res">restaurant</a> is a public place that sells food and drinks to people. The word "restaurant" comes from the French word restaurer, which means "to restore" or "provide food for". In restaurants, food is usually served at the table by a waiter or waitress. When starting a restaurant business, the business owner must decide on the restaurant's concept, theme, interior design, cuisine, and menu. The menu, theme, interior design, and service style should be in sync. The cuisine chosen can significantly influence the restaurant's success, and can help distinguish the restaurant from competitors and attract the target market

    <p id="menu"> 
        <h4>menu</h4> 
        <p>In a restaurant, the menu is a list of food and beverages offered to customers and the prices. A menu may be à la carte – which presents a list of options from which customers choose – or table d'hôte, in which case a pre-established sequence of courses is offered. </p>

        <h4>A dark lord misdirect</details></h4>
        <pIt's an unusual decision for the writers' room to have made, but it works well in the context of this opening gambit. Not only does it make the season 1 finale feel novel among its contemporaries, but it also begins the episode's dalliance with multiple misdirects about who Sauron really is.
Alone after parting ways with the Harfoots in episode 7, The Stranger comes across some Hobbit-like creatures during a storm, who make off with the apple Nori gifted to The Stranger after he drops it. Catching up with these individuals, The Stranger is delighted to find that it's Nori – except it's not. It's The Dweller masquerading as Nori, who has have lured The Stranger to a meet and greet with her fellow Mystics. </p>

        <img src="episode 2.webp" width="100" height="100">
        <h4>I am no man</h4>
        <p>Meanwhile, The Mystics seemingly convince The Stranger that he's Sauron. That's based on his extremely powerful abilities, not to mention he fell from the sky in a meteor. Oh, and the fact that The Nomad has a shield marked with the same star constellation seen on The Stranger's note. Seems ominous, right?

As the group continue to butter The Stranger up, though, he begins to tap into his otherworldly powers, which seems to startle them. So The Dweller knocks him out and ties him up so he can't use his abilities. Go figure.

All hope seems lost for our superpowered friend. That is, until Nori and company show up. Marigold and Poppy lure two of The Mystics away, allowing Nori and Sadoc to reach The Stranger to rescue him.</p>

        <h4>The king is dead, long live the queen</h4>
        <p>Over in Númenor, and with King Palantir on his deathbed, Pharazôn assembles the best Builder's Guild staff – apprentice Eärien included – to spend an hour apiece with the king to sketch his likeness. The best portrait will be used to sculpt a monument to Palantir to honor his legacy once he passes.

            During Eärien's stint, Palantir wakes up. Believing Eärien to be his daughter (and Queen Regent) Míriel, he tells her that Númenor must unite and begin to fully follow the Valar again. Opening a secret passageway, Palantir sends Eärien to a hidden room where she comes across the palantír, the seeing stone Míriel showed to Galadriel in episode 4. That's not good but, given she's been sidelined for much of season 1, here's hoping Eärien's discovery of the palantír sets up a bigger and more ominous season 2 arc for Elendil's naive daughter.</p>

        <h4>Three Rings for the Elven-kings under the sky
        </h4>
        <p>Galadriel, who has grown suspicious of Halbrand's true motives – he's since convinced Celebrimbor to forge two of the titular rings instead of a crown, after all – asks an elven historian for records of the Southlands' royal lineage. Later, she's presented with a scroll detailing the Southlands' line of kings – and what she learns makes for the ultimate betrayal: Halbrand isn't the heir to the Southlands throne. In fact, there's been no Southlands monarch for a millennia.</p>
